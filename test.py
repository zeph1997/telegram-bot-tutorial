# An example of python variables and what they can do

# Integers, float (decimals) can perform mathematical computations + - * /

# Strings are a string of characters. Do note that characters can include spaces and symbols

# Strings can also be added together to make longer strings. But cannot be subtracted

# Call only one element. Take note the elements start from 0
# Call out the number 90!

# Split long texts into lists
